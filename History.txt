== TRUNK 2007-08-22

* New manifest actions:
  * m.folder - copies over all files in folder into target path

== 1.0.3 2007-08-22

* /generators folder is automatically picked up by all component/app generators [bug fix]

== 1.0.2 2007-08-22

* Renamed rubigen_install_script -> install_rubigen_script
* install_rubigen_script is now a component generator so can be reused by other generators to create script/generate
* Added "Thanks to Jeremy Kemper" into website
* Cleaned up USAGE for test_unit
* If a generator does not have a USAGE file, then it is invisible from lists of available generators.
  This will be the mechanism for having hidden generators (e.g. install_rubigen_scripts)

== 1.0.1 2007-08-20

* Moved builtin generators into root folders, away from lib folder, to protected them
  from ri/rdocs processes (which didn't like ERb <%= %> inside Ruby files)
* New app: rubigen_install_script
  * adds script/generate and script/destroy to current folder

== 1.0.0 2007-08-17
* 1 major enhancement:
  * Initial release
